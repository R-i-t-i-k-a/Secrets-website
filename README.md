# Secrets Web Application

This is a web application that allows users to share secrets anonymously. It provides user authentication using Passport.js and Google OAuth2. Users can register, log in, and submit secrets once authenticated.

## Features

- User registration: Users can create accounts by providing a username and password.
- User login: Registered users can log in to access their account.
- Google OAuth2 authentication: Users can also authenticate using their Google accounts.
- Secrets submission: Authenticated users can submit secrets anonymously.
- View secrets: Authenticated users can view and read the secrets shared by other users.
- Logout: Users can log out of their accounts.

## Prerequisites

To run this application, you need the following:

- Node.js installed on your machine
- MongoDB database
